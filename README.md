I am a quality conscious programmer with over 26 years of hands-on experience with a wide range of web technologies. Experienced Coder of Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and Hollywood. A nature loving creature, I take pride in delivering lucid, maintainable code.

My coding experience includes:
+ a Municipal Bond Trading system
+ a Financial Trade positions reconciliation system
+ one of the most highly trafficked ecommerce sites
+ a B2B web/mobile financial application

I have many years of positive experience as a remote worker, which implies a combination of self-organization, writing skills, and an adaptive mindset. I communicate effectively and deliver results in a timely manner. I love a challenging problem, and quickly learn the tools and technologies needed to implement practical solutions.

During a sabbatical, I designed an algorithm to solve a Graph Theory problem, implemented in Perl.

I am an American with a degree in Computer Science. My current interests include electronica, writing sci-fi, and nature photography.

Here's a haiku I wrote more than a decade ago. It's called: "a prime bug"

    #!perl
    chomp and print join ',',  grep $_, (map length, split /[a,]/), "\n" while <DATA>;
    __END__
    a bug trapped inside
    a paper lantern, arid
    aflutter, ablaze
